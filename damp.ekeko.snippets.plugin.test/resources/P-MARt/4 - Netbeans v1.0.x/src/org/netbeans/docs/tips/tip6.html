Click the <b>Browsing</b> workspace tab to open the
Object Browser and browse objects from a more
Java-oriented perspective. The Object Browser
is divided into three panes -- packages,
objects, and members. For each pane
you can set filters to specify the types
of items you want to browse.

Just as in the Explorer, context menus are available
for each node.
