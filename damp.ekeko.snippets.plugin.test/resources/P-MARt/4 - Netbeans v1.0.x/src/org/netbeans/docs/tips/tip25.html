To have classes run when the IDE starts, you can place classes under the <code>Startup</code> node in the
Global Options window.

<p>Create the class in the Explorer, right-click on its Explorer node, and choose <strong>Copy</strong> from the 
contextual menu. Then choose <strong>Tools | Global Options</strong> from the main menu, right-click on the 
<code>Startup</code> node, and choose <strong>Paste | Copy</strong> from the contextual menu.  

<p>This technique can be used to customize parts of the IDE.
