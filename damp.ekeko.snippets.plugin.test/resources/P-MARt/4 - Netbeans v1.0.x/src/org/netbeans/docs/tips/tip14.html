In the Explorer, each type of data that the IDE can work with is
represented by a special icon and a special set of
properties on its property sheet. For example, a
<code>JFrame</code> form named <code>MyForm</code> with the
associated <code>MyForm.java</code> and <code>MyForm.class</code>
is presented to you as one integrated object.
