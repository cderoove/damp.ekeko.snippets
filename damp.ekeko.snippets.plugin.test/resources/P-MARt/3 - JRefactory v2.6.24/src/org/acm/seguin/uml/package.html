Responsible for drawing the UML class diagrams.  This package
contains all the various components to draw the UML class
diagram.  The main pieces are the UMLPackage, which serves
as a background.  UMLClass holds a particular class, and
UMLField, UMLMethod, and UMLNestedClass are each lines in the
UMLClass.<P>

To add more items to the menu that pops up on the class diagrams,
edit UMLPopupMenu.  This menu has been broken into a number
of methods each generating a particular submenu.  The ActionListener
that is invoked are stored either in org.acm.seguin.uml.refactor
if it is a refactoring, or org.acm.seguin.ide.common.<P>

The reason to place it in ide.common is that we want to isolate
changes that are specific to a particular release of an editor.
This makes it easier to add the feature to other editors.<P>
